- 'git add' adds the files to the staging area --> .git/index reference to those files 
- 'git commit' takes a snapshot of the staged files

- we can use 'commit -am' if you want to add and commit at the same command BUT it's only used when we already made at least one commit to this file before , we can't use it if this file wasn't committed before on this repo

- ' git checkout -- filename.extension ' will revert this file to its state to the last committed state 

- we can make an alias to represent some difficult command to make it easier to use in the future 
The command git config -- global alias.aliasname "complex cgit command"
Then we may use directly git alias name and the complex command will be executed directly

- the staging area is inside .git/index , it carries a reference for the files that have been changed

-TAGS: we make it to mark the last commit for example that we have made if wen want to get back to it at any time 

'git tag tagname' and the tag will be created , we need to dig deeper in tags

-STASH:' git stash ' if you want to stash a certain commit for now and then it will be used later
' Git stash list ' lists all the stashes that we have
' Git stash pop ' the commit will be back again into the staging area
